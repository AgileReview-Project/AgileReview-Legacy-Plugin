	<h1>Quickstart</h1>
    <p>
    The following is a quick start guide to the AgileReview project, an eclipse plugin for code-reviewing.
    It is meant to walk you through the basic steps to use this plugin seriously. 
    This means to do code-review in a most efficient way.
    </p>
    <h2>Short Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    This plugin is used to do code reviewing in your development environment (Eclipse). 
    So it is possibel to switch between the development perspective and the code-reviewing perspective as quick as it is possible.
    There is no more effort in setting up an own review environment in another software (eg Excel). 
    This code-reviewing is working with two different levels:
    <ul>
    	<li><b>review level:</b> <br />
        On this level it is possibe to create, change and delete reviews. 
        A review is a (big) section of the code or project in which a special reviewer surveys the developed code and gives comments to this.</li>
        <li><b>comment level:</b> <br />
        On this level it is possibel to create, change and delete comments.
        These comments are the comments the reviewer wants to make regarding the developed code. 
        Therefore it is possible to have a lot of comments under only one review</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <h2>Using Agilereview</h2>
    <p>We try to provide a cheatsheet for all of the now mentioned actions in the help section.
    </p>
    <h3>Create new Review</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Go into the ReviewExplorer</li>
        <li>Go on the add-new-review icon <img src="../../icons/review/review_add_15x15.png" /> <br />
        --> NewReview wizard starts</li>
        <li>Insert data for the review (Especially the ReviewName can not be empty)</li>
        <li>Confirm this data with <i>Finish</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now the Review with its date is created and shown in the ReviewExploere as acive review. 
    And also the Detail view shows the inserted detail data of this review.</p>
    <h3>Change Review</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Go into the ReviewExplorer</li>
        <li>Select the review you want to change<br />
        --> the detail view opens the selected review</li>
        <li>Go into the detail view</li>
        <li>Change the data</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, when the detail view looses the focus the next time all the changes you made will be saved.</p>
    <h3>Delete Review</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Go into the ReviewExplorer</li>
        <li>Select the review(s) you want to delete</li>
        <li>Press <i>DEL</i>or the delete-icon to delete thee selected review(s)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Create new Comment</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Activate a review in the ReviewExplorer</li>
        <li>Select the code line(s)/section where the comment should be placed</li>
        <li>Go on the add-new-comment icon <img src="../../icons/comment/comment_add_15x15.png" /> <br />
        --> Comment detail opens</li>
        <li>Insert comment data</li>
    </ol>
   	<p>
    Now, when the detail view looses the focus the next time all the changes you made will be saved. 
    The inserted comment is shown in the CommentSummary view with most of the data.
    </p>
    <h3>Change Comment</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Go into the CommentSummary view</li>
        <li>Select the comment you want to change<br />

        <li>Go into the detail view</li>
        <li>Change the data</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, when the detail view looses the focus the next time all the changes you made will be saved.</p>
